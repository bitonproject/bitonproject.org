### Is biton anonymous? - NOT YET!

If you need to hide your identity, biton is not ready for that just yet.
Instead, take a look at [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and
[I2P](https://geti2p.net) for anonymous browsing, or at
[Freenet](https://freenetproject.org) for anonymous publishing.


### The juicy details

biton is a peer-to-peer network built around *swarms* — groups of peers that
store encrypted files and relay requests through one another. biton swarms
interconnect in a global network that provides plausible deniability, meaning
that adversaries cannot be sure about who originally made a request. In this
way, biton can be used for evading information controls and for building
community networks around local data and services.


### Come along and BYOb (\*Bring Your Own biton)

Make the network stronger by
[running a relay](https://github.com/bitonproject/biton),
[contributing](CONTRIBUTORS.md) to the project,
[building biton applications](https://github.com/bitonproject/js-libp2p-biton),
and volunteering to your local community kitchen.
