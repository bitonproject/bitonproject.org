# What information can others learn about me?

The degree to which you can trust biton depends on the context of your digital and physical relationships. Understanding what information to hide and from whom is unique for [each one of us](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication) and [our communities](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org). Coming up with a security plan starts with assessing the privacy and security risks of your communications against specific adversarial actors; a technique called [threat modeling](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/your-security-plan).

In this guide we ask the following questions:

* Who can observe my communications? (Internet Service Providers, state-level actors, centralized platforms, operating systems)
* What can they infer about me and my group? (social graph, timing of messages, political stance)
* How can they interfere with my communications? (man-in-the middle attacks, censorship, Deep Packet Inspection, attacks to peer-to-peer networks etc.)
