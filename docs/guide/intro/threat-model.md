# What information can others learn about me?

The degree to which you can trust biton depends on the context of your digital and physical relationships. Understanding what information to hide and from whom is unique for [each one of us](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication) and [our communities](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org). Coming up with a security plan starts with assessing the privacy and security risks of your communications against specific adversarial actors; a technique called [threat modeling](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/your-security-plan).

In this guide we ask the following questions:

* Who can observe my communications? (Internet Service Providers, state-level actors, centralized platforms, operating systems)
* What can they infer about me and my group? (social graph, timing of messages, political stance)
* How can they interfere with my communications? (man-in-the middle attacks, censorship, Deep Packet Inspection, attacks to peer-to-peer networks etc.)

While some of the security concerns relate to the technical components of biton, others relate to your personal and organizational security practices. For practical advice on how to assess your threat model and use secure communication tools refer to a [CryptoParty](https://www.cryptoparty.in/) near you. In fact, your local CryptoParty might be running a biton swarm that you can join.
