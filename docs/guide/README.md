# Introducing biton, the Internet potluck

biton proposes an information-centric, service-oriented networking model built around the
concept of swarms: local clusters of nodes that gather around a common resource or
service. For instance, a swarm could be the viewers of an online conference stream, or a
shared repository with open data in the context of a neighborhood. Effectively, biton
leverages the emergent trust in these utility networks to thwart adversaries from
isolating nodes (eclipse attacks).

At the same time, swarms reinforce digital sovereignty:
content remains local to the participants of the swarm and is not shared with third
parties, thus giving users better control over their data. In fact, trust is built
from the bottom up, and the trust relationships are leveraged both by the network
operations, and by applications that include the [biton module](https://github.com/bitonproject/biton).
